# dwarp: learning-based image registration

This repository contains code for:
 - **POLAFFINI**: a feature-based polyaffine initialization for improved non-linear image Registration [1]. 
 - **dwarp**: tools for non-linear image registration to a template using Voxelmorph [2] core.
 
# Tutorial

We have several VoxelMorph tutorials:
  - [1] **POLAFFINI** [IPMI 2023 paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-34048-2_47.pdf?pdf=inline%20link).
  - [2] **Voxelmorph** [github](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph) - a general purpose library for learning-based tools for alignment/registration, and more generally modelling with deformations. In addition to the code, a list of their papers is available there. Especially, if using **dwarp**, please cite Voxelmorph's TMI 2019 and MICCAI 2018 articles.
